        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to
          describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured.
          This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other
          forms of multimedia on a webpage. HTML is a formal recommendation by
          the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by all
          major web browsers, including both desktop and mobile web browsers.
          HTML5 is the latest version of the specification. HTML is a text file
          containing specific syntax, file and naming conventions that show the
          computer and the web server that it is in HTML and should be read as
          such. By applying these HTML conventions to a text file in virtually
          any text editor, a user can write and design a basic webpage, and then
          upload it to the internet.</br><br>The most basic of HTML conventions is the
          inclusion of a document type declaration at the beginning of the text
          file. This always comes first in the document, because it is the piece
          that affirmatively informs a computer that this is an HTML file. The
          document header typically looks like this: (!DOCTYPE html). It should
          always be written that way, without any content inside it or breaking
          it up. Any content that comes before this declaration will not be
          recognized as HTML by a computer. Doctypes are not just used for HTML,
          they can apply to the creation of any document that uses SGML
          (Standard Generalized Markup Language). SGML is a standard for
          specifying a specific markup language being used. HTML is one of
          several markup languages that SGML and doctype declarations apply to.
          <br><br>The other critical requirement for creating an HTML file is saving it
          with a .html file extension. Whereas the doctype declaration signals
          HTML to the computer from the inside of the file, the file extension
          signals HTML to the computer from the outside of the file. By having
          both, a computer can tell that it's an HTML file whether it's reading
          the file or not. This becomes especially important when uploading the
          files to the web, because the web server needs to know what to do with
          the files before it can send them to a client computer for the inner
          contents to be read. After writing the doctype and saving as an HTML
          file, a user can implement all the other syntactic tools of HTML to
          customize a web page. Once finished, they will likely have several
          HTML files corresponding to various pages of the website. It's
          important that the user uploads these files in the same hierarchy that
          they saved them in, as each page references the specific file paths of
          the other pages, enabling links between them. Uploading them in a
          different order will cause links to break and pages to be lost,
          because the specified file paths will not match the pages.
          <br><br>Basic elements of HTML
Using HTML, a text file is further marked up with additional text describing how the document should be displayed. To keep the markup separate from the actual content of the HTML file, there is a special, distinguishing HTML syntax that is used. These special components are known as HTML tags. The tags can contain name-value pairs known as attributes, and a piece of content that is enclosed within a tag is referred to as an HTML element.
HTML elements always have opening tags, content in the middle and closing tags. Attributes can provide additional information about the element and are included in the opening tag. Elements can be described in one of two ways:
<br>[1] Block-level elements start on a new line in the document and take up their own space. Examples of these elements include headings and paragraph tags.
<br>[2] Inline elements do not start on a new line in the document and only take up necessary space. These elements usually format the contents of block-level elements. Examples of inline elements include hyperlinks and text format tags.

        <p>What Is CSS?
Cascading style sheets (CSS) is defined as a style sheet language developed in the 1990s to support the styling of web documents,
which is now an essential skill for web developers and one of the key pillars of the internet user experience that works in conjunction with various markup languages. 
<br><br>CSS is a style sheet programming language that helps configure and manage the appearance and formatting of a document created in a markup language. It gives HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) an extra feature. It’s typically combined with HTML to modify the look and feel of web pages and user interfaces. 

<br><br>In 1996, W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) created CSS for a clear purpose. The tags that would assist in formatting the page were not intended for HTML elements. Although CSS isn’t strictly required, you wouldn’t want to visit a website that solely contains HTML elements because it would seem quite plain. For this reason, the CSS style has several components:
<br><br>

1. Selector
Selectors pinpoint the HTML components on web pages that need styling. The HTML elements that one should choose to have the CSS property values in the rule applied to them are specified by a pattern of terms and other elements called CSS selectors. Selectors include:

Simple selectors (for elements based on name, id, and class)
Combinator selectors (for elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (for elements based on a particular state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (to style a part of an element)
Selectors for attributes (for elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
<br><br>2. Properties
The styles used on specific selectors are CSS properties. It functions similarly to attributes like background color, font size, position, etc. The CSS ruleset places them before values, and a colon separates them from property values. There are several attributes for various HTML selectors and elements.

Some properties can be applied to any selector and are universal. Others only operate in certain situations and on specific selectors. Grid-template-columns, which are used to style the page layout, are an example. It primarily functions with divs with the grid display property set (we shall look at the key properties of CSS later in the article). HTML selectors also have numerous characteristics and their corresponding values.

<br><br>3. Values
Values that are assigned to properties define those properties. In CSS, text values are common. In contrast to strings, they are typically written without quotations. In addition to text, CSS values can also take the shape of URLs, measures, numbers, etc. Specific CSS attributes permit integer definitions for their values, including negative numbers.

One can express CSS values in various property-specific units, but standard units include px, em, fr, and percentages. CSS values can have several values and can be used to create shorthand by manipulating them. Properties like background images require an actual URL as their value.
